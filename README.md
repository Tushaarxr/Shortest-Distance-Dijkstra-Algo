# Shortest-Distance-Dijkstra-Algo

## Introduction
This C program demonstrates the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest distance between cities in a given graph. The program reads a graph representing the connections and distances between cities, then calculates and displays the shortest distance from a specified source city to all other cities.

## Requirements
- C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Standard C library


## Implementation Details
The program uses an adjacency matrix to represent the graph and applies Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths. The algorithm maintains a priority queue to efficiently select the next vertex with the minimum distance.
